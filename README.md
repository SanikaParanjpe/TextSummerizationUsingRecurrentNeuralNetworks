# Text Summerization Using Recurrent Neural Networks

Text summarization is a ubiquitous application. It can be used for news summarization, product review, youtube video title generation and more. In this project, we built a model that summarizes a given document or a given text paragraph. There are various ways to do this; we used a neural network approach. We uses a Recurrent Neural Network with gated recurrent unit (GRU) and compared the results with the Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) model for the same datasets. We applied text summarization on CNN/Daily News dataset and extended it on Amazon Fine Food Reviews.
